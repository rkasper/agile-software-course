                <h2>Goal</h2>
                <p>By the conclusion of this course, you'll have a deep understanding of Agile software development, empowering you to excel as a leader or valuable member of a high-performing software product development team.</p>
                <h2>Agile Values &amp; Principles</h2>
                <p>This course is firmly rooted in the values and principles of the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/" target="_blank">Agile manifesto</a>. In this course, we value</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Individuals and interactions, fostering an environment that encourages class participation, collaborative homework assignments, and a group final project.</li>
                    <li>Working software, so we learn and apply Agile technical skills, culminating in a final project that produces a real working software product.</li>
                    <li>Customer collaboration, so our final project is centered around a genuine stakeholder.</li>
                    <li>Responding to change, allowing us to adapt our course backlog, homework assignments, and final project to ensure optimal learning outcomes.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Learning Resources</h2>
                <p>While there's no mandatory reading for this course, we provide a curated list of recommended resources, including books, articles, podcasts, and videos. Each item in our <a href="backlog.html">course backlog</a>&nbsp;comes with its own tailored list of suggested resources. These materials are designed to deepen your understanding of the course content. We believe in your intrinsic motivation to learn, practice, and internalize the course material, and we encourage you to engage with these resources to enhance your learning experience.</p>
                <h2>Class Dates and Location<br></h2>
                <p>For <strong>Summer 2023</strong>, we're excited to welcome you back on campus! Our meetings will take place in the classroom from 3:15-6:15 pm ET for three enriching weeks starting on June 20:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Week 1: June 20-23</li>
                    <li>Week 2: June 26-29</li>
                    <li>Week 3: July 3, 5-6</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In Fall 2022, we embraced a "hybrid" approach. Our virtual meetings were held on Mondays from 3:00-5:00 pm ET starting on August 29, complemented by an immersive on-campus weekend on September 10-11.</p>
                <h2>Communication<br></h2>
                <p>We champion open and transparent communication in this course. Most of our course-related discussions and interactions take place on <a href="https://agilesoftwarecourse.slack.com/archives/C04MR39037S">Slack</a>. To become part of our vibrant Slack community, simply&nbsp;<a href="mailto:r@kasperowski.com?subject=Harvard%20Agile:%20help%20with%20Slack" target="_blank">request an invitation from Richard</a>.</p>
                <h2>Accessibility<br></h2>
                <p>The school is committed to providing an accessible academic community. The Accessibility Office offers a variety of accommodations and services to students with documented disabilities. Please visit <a href="https://extension.harvard.edu/for-students/support-and-services/accessibility-services/">Accessibility Services</a> for more information.<br></p>
                <h2>Academic Integrity<br></h2>
                <p>You are responsible for understanding <a href="https://extension.harvard.edu/for-students/student-policies-conduct/expectations/">the school's policies on academic integrity</a> and how to use sources responsibly. Not knowing the rules, misunderstanding the rules, running out of time, submitting the wrong draft, or being overwhelmed with multiple demands are not acceptable excuses. To support your learning about academic citation rules, please visit the <a href="https://extension.harvard.edu/for-students/student-policies-conduct/academic-integrity/">Resources to Support Academic Integrity</a>&nbsp;where you will find links to the Harvard Guide to Using Sources and two free online 15-minute tutorials to test your knowledge of academic citation policy. The tutorials are anonymous open-learning tools.<br></p>

                <h2>Course Backlog<br></h2>
                <p> In keeping with Agile values and principles, we use a dynamic <a href="backlog.html">course backlog</a>&nbsp;— a learning backlog — instead of a traditional syllabus. This backlog outlines the topics we aim to explore during the semester. Each item in the backlog comes with a brief description, a set of activities, a list of recommended resources, and a projected date for discussion. Please note that the sequence of topics and dates may be adjusted throughout the semester to ensure timely and relevant coverage of each topic.</p>
                <h2>Homework &amp; Grading<br></h2>
                <p>Our semester is divided into two phases. In the first half, we'll focus on understanding Agile principles through online quizzes and programming problems as part of your homework. These assignments are designed to facilitate your learning journey.</p>

                <p><strong>Your final grade for the semester will be calculated as follows:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Class participation: 20% for undergraduates, 10% for graduates</li>
                    <li>Homework: 50% for both undergraduates and graduates</li>
                    <li>Final project: 30% for undergraduates, 40% for graduates</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A letter grade will be given in accordance with <a href="https://www.extension.harvard.edu/grades">the School's grading policy</a>.&nbsp;You can check your grades on the course&nbsp;<a href="https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/119743">Canvas site</a>.&nbsp;(Note: Undergraduates will need to calculate their grades based on these percentages.)</p>
                <p>We adopt a&nbsp;<strong>completion grading</strong>&nbsp;approach in this course, where you earn credit for each completed portion of an assignment. We believe this approach promotes better learning outcomes and fosters a more equitable classroom environment.</p>
                <p><strong>Class participation</strong>: Full credit is awarded for attending and actively participating in all class sessions. Active participation includes being present with video and audio during virtual sessions, engaging in activities, contributing ideas during discussions, asking questions, and sharing your knowledge with fellow students and course staff.</p>
                <p><strong>Homework</strong>: Homework assignments are due before the next class. For full credit, you need to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Submit your homework on time.</li>
                    <li>Answer all questions correctly on multiple-choice homework (you have unlimited attempts!).</li>
                    <li>Submit written responses for written-response homework.</li>
                    <li>Submit working code and executable artifacts for programming assignments, created using Pair or Mob Programming, Test-Driven Development, and other Agile technical skills.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Final project</strong>: You'll work in teams to design, implement, and deliver a full software product. The entire team receives the same grade. For full credit, your team needs to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Follow the steps outlined in each time-boxed project segment.</li>
                    <li>Have a working increment of software product at the end of each time-boxed project segment.</li>
                    <li>Resolve team dynamics issues as they arise.</li>
                    <li>Deliver the final product and present it to students, course staff, and external stakeholders on the final day of class.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>All homework assignments and grades can be accessed on Canvas</strong></p>
